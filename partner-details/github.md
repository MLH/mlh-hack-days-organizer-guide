The collaboration between MLH and GitHub is specifically designed to support **High School** organizers in the **United States (US) only**. If your event does not meet both criteria, you are encouraged to apply for a [Google Gemini Hack Day](google-gemini.md) instead. Please note that Gemini events require participants to be 18 years of age or older.
